# Kakapo_eDNA

This repository contains the python and R scripts as well as additional material for our kakapo eDNA project, where we pushed the boundaries of environmental DNA (eDNA) research through long-read nanopore sequencing of haplotypes.

The raw metabarcoding data can be accessed via SRA under the NCBI BioProject ID PRJNA806467: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/806467

The basecalled nanopore data can be accessed via SRA under the NCBI BioProject ID PRJNA812072: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/812072
